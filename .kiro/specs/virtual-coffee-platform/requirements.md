# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Virtual Coffee Platform is a multi-tenant application that enables teams and offices to organize virtual coffee meetings through automated matching and scheduling. The platform consists of a Go-based backend API, a simple frontend interface, and supporting AWS infrastructure, all deployed via ArgoCD on AWS EKS. The system supports multiple isolated deployments to serve different teams or offices independently.
