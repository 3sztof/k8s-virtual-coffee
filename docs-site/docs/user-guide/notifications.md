# Notifications

The Virtual Coffee Platform keeps you informed about matches and important updates through its notification system.

## Notification Types

### Match Notifications

When you're matched with a colleague, you'll receive a notification containing:

- Your match's name and profile information
- Suggested meeting times based on your shared availability
- A link to view the match details in the platform
- Contact information for scheduling

Match notifications are typically sent at the beginning of each matching cycle (usually weekly, but this may vary based on your organization's settings).

### Reminder Notifications

The system sends reminders about:

- **Upcoming coffee chats**: Sent 24 hours before scheduled meetings
- **Unscheduled matches**: Sent 3 days after a match if no meeting has been scheduled
- **Feedback requests**: Sent after a scheduled meeting time has passed

These reminders help ensure you don't miss any coffee chat opportunities.

### System Notifications

You'll also receive notifications about:

- Changes to the platform schedule
- Updates to the platform features
- Administrative announcements
- Changes to your account or preferences made by administrators

## Notification Channels

The Virtual Coffee Platform supports multiple notification channels:

### Email

### Notification Schedule

You can set a "quiet time" when you don't want to receive notifications:

1. Go to your notification preferences
2. Set your "Do Not Disturb" hours
3. Notifications during this time will be delayed until after your quiet time ends

## Troubleshooting Notifications

If you're not receiving notifications:

1. Check your notification preferences to ensure you haven't opted out
2. Verify that your email address or other contact information is correct
3. Check your spam/junk folder for email notifications

3. Consider changing your notification channel to one that's less intrusive
