# Troubleshooting

This guide helps you resolve common issues you might encounter while using the Virtual Coffee Platform.

## Common Issues

### Account and Access Issues

#### Unable to Log In

If you're having trouble logging in:

1. **Check your credentials**:
   - Verify that you're using the correct email address
   - Make sure your password is correct (if using password authentication)

2. **Check authentication method**:
   - Ensure you're using the correct authentication method (AWS SSO, Google, etc.)
   - If using SSO, make sure you're logged into your organization's SSO provider

3. **Clear browser cache and cookies**:
   - Sometimes cached data can cause login issues
   - Try using a private/incognito window

4. **Contact your administrator**:
   - If you still can't log in, your account may need to be reset
   - Contact your organization's platform administrator

#### Account Locked

If your account is locked:

1. Wait 30 minutes and try again
2. Use the "Forgot Password" option if available
3. Contact your administrator for account reset

### Matching Issues

#### Not Receiving Matches

If you're not being matched with colleagues:

1. **Check your participation status**:
   - Ensure your participation is set to "Active" (not paused)
   - Check your dashboard for any status messages

2. **Review your availability settings**:
   - Limited availability reduces your chances of being matched
   - Add more time slots to increase matching opportunities

3. **Check deployment size**:
   - Small deployments may have fewer matching opportunities
   - The system requires at least 4 active users for optimal matching

4. **Verify matching schedule**:
   - Matches are typically created on a set schedule (e.g., weekly)
   - Check with your administrator for the matching schedule

#### Unable to Schedule a Meeting

If you're having trouble scheduling a meeting with your match:

1. **Check communication channels**:
   - Ensure you're using the correct contact information
   - Try alternative communication methods if one isn't working

2. **Review availability**:
   - Double-check your shared availability times
   - Consider updating your availability if needed

3. **Request a rematch**:
   - If you can't connect after multiple attempts, request a rematch
   - This will match both of you with new partners in the next cycle

### Notification Issues

#### Not Receiving Notifications

If you're not receiving notifications:

1. **Check notification preferences**:
   - Verify that you haven't opted out of notifications
   - Ensure your preferred notification channels are selected

2. **Verify contact information**:
   - Check that your email address is correct
   - Verify other contact details (Slack handle, phone number, etc.)

3. **Check spam/junk folders**:
   - Email notifications might be filtered as spam
   - Add the platform's email address to your safe senders list

4. **Check permissions**:
   - Ensure you've granted necessary permissions for notification channels
   - For Slack, verify that the app has permission to message you

### Platform Performance Issues

#### Slow Loading Times

If the platform is loading slowly:

1. **Check your internet connection**
2. **Clear browser cache and cookies**
3. **Try a different browser**
4. **Disable browser extensions that might interfere**

#### Features Not Working

If certain features aren't working:

1. **Refresh the page**
2. **Clear browser cache**
3. **Check if you're using a supported browser**:
   - Chrome (recommended)
   - Firefox
   - Safari
   - Edge
